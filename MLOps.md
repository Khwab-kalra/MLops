# MLOps Documentation
## 1. Introduction

Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps, is a set of practices and tools that combine machine learning (ML) system development and operations to enhance collaboration and communication between data science and operations teams. The goal of MLOps is to fully automate and streamline the ML lifecycle, from model building and data preparation to deployment and monitoring.

## 2. What is MLOps?

MLOps is a methodology that integrates machine learning models into the software development and deployment process. It promotes collaboration and communication between data scientists, who build and train models, and operations engineers, who deploy and manage them in production environments. By applying DevOps principles to machine learning, MLOps ensures that ML models are developed, deployed, and maintained efficiently and effectively.

## 3. Why MLOps?

Traditional machine learning development often faces challenges when transitioning from experimentation to production. MLOps addresses these challenges by providing a framework for managing ML models at scale, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining the quality and reliability of ML systems in production.

## **The ML Conundrum: Challenges in Deployment and Maintenance**

Developing a machine learning model is akin to crafting a masterpiece – it requires creativity, finesse, and deep understanding. Data scientists meticulously curate algorithms, fine-tune hyperparameters, and validate models to ensure accuracy. However, the real challenge arises when these models need to move from experimentation to real-world applications.

In production, ML models face hurdles such as data drift, where the patterns in real-world data differ from the training data, leading to reduced accuracy. Ensuring the reliability and scalability of these models becomes a daunting task. Moreover, the collaboration chasm between data scientists, who create models, and IT operations teams, who deploy and manage them, often results in bottlenecks, slowing down innovation and implementation.
